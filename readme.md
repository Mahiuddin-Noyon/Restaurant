Overview the web template
A restaurant web page which is used to sell food to the customers. This template have two different part as customer end and admin panel.
Customers can view food and choose item that he/she searching for and order as per need. They can make reservation for a specific date and time. Also they can contact the admin as needed and have a confirmation on their email. On the other hand admin can add, edit, delete, update items, sliders, sorting items as categories, make categories. As well as admin can manage all the categories. Admin can view customer's reservation/contact and confirm them by the capabilities. That's all for now and it is still upgrading day by day.
